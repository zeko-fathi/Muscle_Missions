## Backend Design
Flask, a lightweight Python framework, is at the heart of Muscle Missions' backend, providing agility and speed. The user data is securely managed in SQLite3 database, chosen for its efficiency and simplicity.

## Database Design
The database is a crucial part of Muscle Missions, featuring tables for user profiles, exercises, workouts, and workout splits. It includes:
- Over 270 exercises with detailed attributes.
- User information, including hashed passwords for security.
- Links between workouts, exercises, and user profiles for easy data retrieval.

## Workout Generation
Muscle Missions uses a REST API to generate workouts. The selection algorithm is based on user preferences and allows for a mix of structured and random elements to provide variety and effectiveness.

## Chatbot Implementation
LiftBot is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo Model, offering personalized advice based on user profiles and workout histories.

## Future Plans
Continued expansion is planned, including adding more exercises, refining the selection algorithm, and incorporating video links for exercises.
