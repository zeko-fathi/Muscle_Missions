# Muscle Missions

Are you bored of your workout routine and need something new in the gym? Muscle Missions can help with that! Muscle Missions is a Web App designed to create customized daily workouts, or weekly workout splits for users. Users can get custom workouts based on their workout experience, equipment access, and exercise limitations. On top of that, users can also chat with an interactive chatbot that gives them tips based off their workouts and exercise advice!

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQLite, Flask, Bootstrap

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write something. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

Optimizations
(optional)

You don't have to include this section but interviewers love that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are GREAT to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or wow I actually did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
